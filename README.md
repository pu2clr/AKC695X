# [PU2CLR AKC695X Arduino Library](https://pu2clr.github.io/AKC695X)

This is an Arduino Library to control the AKC695X / M695X DSP radio devices. 

This library was built based on [AKC6955 stereo FM / TV / MW / SW / LW digital tuning radio](http://maximradio.altervista.org/akc6955/AKC6955-datasheet-english.pdf) document from "AKC technology".  Others sources help the author to build this library. You can check these sources on [References](https://pu2clr.github.io/AKC695X/#references). 

The PU2CLR AKC695X Arduino Library also intend to be used on __all members of the AKC695X family with I²C  bus interface__ respecting, of course, the features available for each IC version. __Please, check the Datasheet of the divice before starting your project__.

__Sources:__  AKC6951, AKC6955 and AKC6959sx Datasheets.

__ATTENTION: The AKC6952 and AKC6959 do not have I²C  interface. So, they will not work with this library. Try AKC6951, AKC6955 or AKC6959sx__.     


## Registers setup


### Register operations
   
This library uses the I²C  protocols to read and write AKC695X registers. In this context, registers are memory position into the device.

The first 13 registers, you can use to change the behavior of the device. They are read and write registers. The registers from 20 to 27, can be used to get the current device status. They are read only registers. 

There is no information about the register 10 and the registers 14 to 19 in the documentation used to develop this library. 

By using the registers 0 to 13, you can change the band, set the frequency, set the channel space, set the audio behavior and volume, set a custom band and more. The file [AKC695X.h](https://github.com/pu2clr/AKC695X/blob/master/AKC695X.h) has details about the all registers used in the library. Also, you can read the [API Documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/AKC695X/extras/docs/html/modules.html) to know more about AKC695X registers. 

To represent the information stored in the AKC695X registers, this library used the resources of the C / C ++ language: union, struct and typedef. This way, the user of this library will be able to customize it easily.

This approach is shown below for the registers 0, 1, 2 and 3.

#### Table Reg0

Reg0: configure register 0 (default: 0x4c) Address - Type 0x00 (RW)

|  BIT  |  Label    |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------------------- |         
|   7   | power_on  |    0     | 1 = On; 0 =  Off     | 
|   6   | fm_en     |    1     | 1 = FM; 0 = AM       |
|   5   | tune      |    0     | 1 = Trigger tune process. The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes | 
|   4   | seek      |    0     | 1 = Trigger tune process. The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes | 
|   3   | seekup    |    1     | 1 = Seek up; 0 = Seek down |
|   2   | mute      |    1     | 0 = Normal operation; 1 = Mute L / R |
| 1:0   | rsv       |   00     | Debug use, do not change this value using |  

Source: [AKC6955 stereo FM / TV / MW / SW / LW digital tuning radio](http://maximradio.altervista.org/akc6955/AKC6955-datasheet-english.pdf) 

Be aware that the table above presents the data in order of the most significant bits to the least significant bits. In C/C++ representation of that data will be inverted. See the C/C++ code below. 


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 0

```cpp
typedef union {
    struct
    {
        uint8_t rsv : 2;      //!< Reserved - Debug use, do not change this value using
        uint8_t mute : 1;     //!< 1 - Mute L / R channel 0 - Normal operation
        uint8_t seekup : 1;   //!< Seek direction control bit. 0 = Seek down;  1 = Seek up
        uint8_t seek : 1;     //!< 0-> 1 Trigger tune process The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes.
        uint8_t tune : 1;     //!< 0-> 1 Trigger tune process The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes.
        uint8_t fm_en : 1;    //!< 1 = FM mode;  0 = AM mode
        uint8_t power_on : 1; //!< 1 = Chip on; 0 = Chip off
    } refined;
    uint8_t raw;
} akc595x_reg0;
```

It is important to say that the code above does not necessarily generate extra machine code. Much more than that, the code above guides the compiler on how to operate with the AKC695X bits stored into its registers. In this case register 0.  If you have some experience in C/C++, you will know when you can use this approach instead direct bit manipulation and vice-versa. 

The code below is an example of how this data structure can be used.

```cpp
void AKC695X::powerOn(uint8_t fm_en, uint8_t tune, uint8_t mute, uint8_t seek, uint8_t seekup)
{
    akc595x_reg0 reg0;

    reg0.refined.power_on = 1;
    reg0.refined.rsv = 0;
    reg0.refined.fm_en = fm_en;
    reg0.refined.mute = mute;
    reg0.refined.seek = seek;
    reg0.refined.seekup = seekup;
    reg0.refined.tune = tune;

    setRegister(REG00, reg0.raw);

}
```


#### Table Reg1

Reg1: configure register 1 (default: 0x10) Address - Type 0x01 (RW)

|  BIT  |  Label    |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------------------- |         
| 7:3   | amband    |  0x2     | see table [Table Reg1 amband]() | 
| 2:0   | fmband    |  0x00    | see table [Table Reg1 fmband]() |   

Source: [AKC6955 stereo FM / TV / MW / SW / LW digital tuning radio](http://maximradio.altervista.org/akc6955/AKC6955-datasheet-english.pdf) 


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 1

```cpp
typedef union {
    struct
    {
        uint8_t fmband : 3; //!<
        uint8_t amband : 4; //!<
    } refined;
    uint8_t raw;
} akc595x_reg1;
```

The code below is an example of how the __akc595x_reg1__ can be used.

```cpp
      .
      .
    akc595x_reg1 reg1;
      .
      .
    reg1.raw = 0;
    reg1.refined.fmband =  fm_band; // Selects the band will be used for FM (see fm band table)
    setRegister(REG01, reg1.raw);
      . 
      .
```

## Schematic 

The main porpuse of this circuit is testing de AKC695X Arduino Library. It does not intend to be a real receiver for exigent listener. However, it is possible to start with it and after add some improvements. On the other hand, with this simple circuit, the experimenter may be surprised with its performance.

The figure below shows the basic schematic of the AKC695X and Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V, 8MHz.
