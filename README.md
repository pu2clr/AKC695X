## Preface

AKC695X device family offer versatile FM/MW/SW/LW receiver solution by reducing the external components usually found in regular receivers. This device family will surprise hobbyists and experimenters with its simplicity to build FM and AM (LW, MW, SW) receivers. 

There are currently some receivers based on DSP technology. The KT0915 and SI4735 devices are some examples widely disseminated in the market. This library was developed with the purpose of expanding the alternatives to hobbyists and radio listeners. 

In this document you will see Arduino source codes, schematics, examples and tips to help you to build a receiver based on Arduino board and AKC695X devices.  The project and examples shown here do not intend to be a real receiver for exigent listener. However, it is possible to start with it and after add some improvements. On the other hand, with the simple circuits shown here, the experimenter may be surprised with the AKC695X performance.

__Sources:__  AKC6951, AKC6955 and AKC6959sx Datasheets.

__ATTENTION: The AKC6952 and AKC6959 do not have I²C  interface. So, they will not work with this library. Try AKC6951, AKC6955 or AKC6959sx__.     


## Registers setup

This library uses the I²C  protocols to read and write AKC695X registers. In this context, registers are memory position into the device. 

The first 13 registers, you can use to change the behavior of the device. They are read and write registers. The registers from 20 to 27, can be used to get the current device status. They are read only registers. 

By writing and reading these register, you can control the AKC695X devices.


### Register operations
   
By using the registers 0 to 13, you can change the band, set the frequency, set the channel space, set the audio behavior and volume, set a custom band and more. The file [AKC695X.h](https://github.com/pu2clr/AKC695X/blob/master/AKC695X.h) has details about the all registers used in the library. Also, you can read the [API Documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/AKC695X/extras/docs/html/modules.html) to know more about AKC695X registers. 

There is no information about the register 10 and the registers 14 to 19 in the documentation used to develop this library. 

To represent the information stored in the AKC695X registers, this library used the resources of the C / C ++ language: union, struct and typedef. This way, the user of this library will be able to customize it easily.

This approach is shown below for the registers 0, 1, 2 and 3.

#### Table Reg0

Reg0: configure register 0 (default: 0x4c) Address - Type 0x00 (RW)

|  BIT  |  Label    |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------------------- |         
|   7   | power_on  |    0     | 1 = On; 0 =  Off     | 
|   6   | fm_en     |    1     | 1 = FM; 0 = AM       |
|   5   | tune      |    0     | 1 = Trigger tune process. The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes | 
|   4   | seek      |    0     | 1 = Trigger tune process. The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes | 
|   3   | seekup    |    1     | 1 = Seek up; 0 = Seek down |
|   2   | mute      |    1     | 0 = Normal operation; 1 = Mute L / R |
| 1:0   | rsv       |   00     | Debug use, do not change this value using |  

Source: [AKC6955 stereo FM / TV / MW / SW / LW digital tuning radio](http://maximradio.altervista.org/akc6955/AKC6955-datasheet-english.pdf) 

Be aware that the table above presents the data in order of the most significant bits to the least significant bits. In C/C++ representation of that data will be inverted. See the C/C++ code below. 


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 0

```cpp
typedef union {
    struct
    {
        uint8_t rsv : 2;      //!< Reserved - Debug use, do not change this value using
        uint8_t mute : 1;     //!< 1 - Mute L / R channel 0 - Normal operation
        uint8_t seekup : 1;   //!< Seek direction control bit. 0 = Seek down;  1 = Seek up
        uint8_t seek : 1;     //!< 0-> 1 Trigger tune process The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes.
        uint8_t tune : 1;     //!< 0-> 1 Trigger tune process The STC bit is set high when the tune operation completes.
        uint8_t fm_en : 1;    //!< 1 = FM mode;  0 = AM mode
        uint8_t power_on : 1; //!< 1 = Chip on; 0 = Chip off
    } refined;
    uint8_t raw;
} akc595x_reg0;
```

It is important to say that the code above does not necessarily generate extra machine code. Much more than that, the code above guides the compiler on how to operate with the AKC695X bits stored into its registers. In this case register 0.  If you have some experience in C/C++, you will know when you can use this approach instead direct bit manipulation and vice-versa. 

The code below is an example of how this data structure can be used.

```cpp
void AKC695X::powerOn(uint8_t fm_en, uint8_t tune, uint8_t mute, uint8_t seek, uint8_t seekup)
{
    akc595x_reg0 reg0;

    reg0.refined.power_on = 1;
    reg0.refined.rsv = 0;
    reg0.refined.fm_en = fm_en;
    reg0.refined.mute = mute;
    reg0.refined.seek = seek;
    reg0.refined.seekup = seekup;
    reg0.refined.tune = tune;

    setRegister(REG00, reg0.raw);

}
```


#### Table Reg1

Reg1: configure register 1 (default: 0x10) Address - Type 0x01 (RW)

|  BIT  |  Label    |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------------------- |         
| 7:3   | amband    |  0x2     | see table [Table Reg1 amband]() | 
| 2:0   | fmband    |  0x00    | see table [Table Reg1 fmband]() |   

Source: [AKC6955 stereo FM / TV / MW / SW / LW digital tuning radio](http://maximradio.altervista.org/akc6955/AKC6955-datasheet-english.pdf) 


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 1

```cpp
typedef union {
    struct
    {
        uint8_t fmband : 3; //!<
        uint8_t amband : 4; //!<
    } refined;
    uint8_t raw;
} akc595x_reg1;
```

The code below is an example of how the __akc595x_reg1__ can be used.

#### Table Reg2  and Reg3

The registers 2 and 3 are used together. The tuning frequency is obtained by calculation. The formula is described below.

#### Reg2

|  BIT  |  Label     |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | ---------  | -------- | -------------------- |         
| 7     |  rsv       |    0     | Reserved for internal use.      | 
| 6     | ref_32k_mo |    1     | 1 = 32.768 crystal; 0 = 12MHz crystal  |
| 5     | Mode3k     |    0     | 1 = 3K custom channel number as the AM mode; 0 = custom channel number pattern 5K |
| 4:0   | Channel    |   0x0A   | The higher 5 bits of the channel number. See comments [ˆ1] and [ˆ2] |


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 2

```cpp
typedef union {
    struct
    {
        uint8_t channel : 5;      //!< (0:4) - 5 most significant bits that represents the channel (see reg3)
        uint8_t mode3k : 1;       //!< (5)   - 1 = 3K; 0 = 5K
        uint8_t ref_32k_mode : 1; //!< (6)   - 1 = 32K ref. crystal clock; 0 = 12MHz ref crystal clock
        uint8_t rsv : 1;          //!< (7)   - Reserved - Debug use, do not change this value using
    } refined;
    uint8_t raw;
} akc595x_reg2;
```



##### Reg3

|  BIT  |  Label     |  Default | Function Description | 
| ----- | ---------  | -------- | -------------------- |         
| 7:0   |  rsv       |   0xC8   | The lower 8 bits of the channel number.  See comment [ˆ1]  | 


[ˆ1]  
1. __On FM mode: Channel Freq = 25kHz * CHAN + 30MHz__; 
2. __On AM mode__: 
   * when 5K channel number pattern, Channel Freq = 5kHz * CHAN 
   * when 3K channel number pattern, Channel Freq = 3kHz * CHAN. 

[ˆ2] __If the MCU is working with MW2 (see table Table Reg1 amband), the channel number has to be a multiple of three. Otherwise, the radio will be a mess.__  


##### Data representation in C/C++ for the register 3

```cpp
typedef uint8_t akc595x_reg3;
```
